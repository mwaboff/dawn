# Coding Standards
Principles to be used when writing for every language.

## Quality Principles

### Readability First
1. Use clear and consistent naming conventions.
2. Self-documenting and understandable code is preferred to in-line comments.
3. Consistent formatting.

### Keep it Simple (KISS)
1. Use the simplest solution that works.
2. Avoid over engineering.
3. Avoid premature optimization.
4. Easier to understand and read is preferred.

### Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
1. Extract common logic into reusable components (functions, abstract classes, etc).
2. Avoid copy-paste programming

**Note:** Balance generalization with the requirement of readability. 

### You Ain't Gonna Need It (YAGNI)
1. Don't build features before they're needed.
2. Avoid speculative generality.
3. Add complexity only when required.
4. Start simple, refactor when needed.
